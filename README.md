# QS AI Project

This project is a prototype for extracting text and dimensional information from architectural PDF drawings for quantity surveying purposes.

## Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point
- `pdf_parser.py`: Uses pdfplumber to extract text data
- `assets/`: Directory to place your sample PDFs
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## How to Use

1. Place your PDF drawings inside the `assets/` folder.
2. Run `main.py` to see extracted text output.

## Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
